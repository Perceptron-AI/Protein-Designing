# Protein Designing

You can find the training and the inference of this repo in this [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nMFTTROi7W4xTvmizRQjuPMcbtNOP-8s?usp=sharing)

This repository contains implementations and illustrative code to accompany open-source publications for protein designing. Inspired by the works of John Ingraham, Vikas Garg, Regina Barzilay and Tommi Jaakkola, NeurIPS 2019 in their paper [Generative Models for Graph-Based Protein Design](https://www.mit.edu/~vgarg/GenerativeModelsForProteinDesign.pdf), we have just updated the code and added a few modification to the existing codebase. 

We also transferred the whole training and inference procedure in Google colab for better interpretability and experimentation. 

All the credits goes to the original authors we have merely updated the code and reduced the complexities.
